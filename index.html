    <h1>Borscht</h1>

    <p>
      is a sour soup of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one of the
      main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same
      name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups
      without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white
      borscht, and cabbage borscht.

    <p>
      Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems,
      leaves and umbels of common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), a herbaceous
      plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With
      time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the
      Ukrainian beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is
      typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables,
      which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions,
      potatoes, and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat
      or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold, and
      it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth
      drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or
      potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and
      side dishes, such as uszka or pampushky, that can be served with the soup.

      In 2022, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
      Organization (UNESCO) announced that it had placed borscht on the List of
      Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding due to the
      risk that Russia's invasion posed to the soup's status as an element of
      Ukraine's cultural heritage. The new status means Ukraine could now apply
      for special funds to finance projects promoting and protecting the dish.
